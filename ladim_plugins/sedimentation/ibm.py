    Lagrangian Advection and DIffusion Solver.

    Solve the diffusion equation in a Lagrangian framework. The equation is

    dc/dt = - grad (vc) + div (K grad c),

    where c is concentration, v is 3-dimensional velocity, K is a diagonal
    tensor (i.e. main axes oriented along coordinate axes) of diffusion.

    This is translated to a stochastic differential equation of the form

    dx = (v_x + d/dx K_xx) * dt + sqrt(2*K_xx) * dw_x,
    dy = (v_y + d/dy K_yy) * dt + sqrt(2*K_yy) * dw_y,
    dz = (v_z + d/dz K_zz) * dt + sqrt(2*K_zz) * dw_z,

    where x, y, z is the spatial position, K_xx, K_yy, K_zz are the diagonal
    elements of K, and dw_x, dw_y, dw_z are Wiener process differential elements
    with zero mean and stdev = sqrt(dt).

    Algorithm:

    Operator splitting: Diffusion first, then advection. Diffusion is solved
    using the gradient-free backwards ItÃ´ scheme, according to LaBolle
    (2000, 10.1029/1999WR900224).

    :param x0: An N x M vector of initial values, where N is the number of
               particles and M is the number of coordinates.
    :param t0: The initial time.
    :param t1: The end time.
    :param v:  The velocity. A function (x, t) --> x-like.
    :param K:  The diagonal elements of the diffusion tensor.
               A function (x, t) --> x-like.
    :return:   An x0-like array of the new particle positions.
